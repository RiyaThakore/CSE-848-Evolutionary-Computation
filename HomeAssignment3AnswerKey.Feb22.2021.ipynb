There is something different about this problem, however, from the usual enumeration problem:  in the “usual” enumeration problem, one must calculate and evaluate all possible solutions (i.e., enumerate them all) in order to know which one is best.  But in the Eight Queens problem, there is a solution criterion known in advance (namely, 0 attacks) that allows the enumeration to be stopped as soon as any solution that satisfies it is found.  Similarly, we can (and I hope you did!) stop the GA whenever it finds a solution with no attacks.  It would be a hard task for a GA to find ALL solutions to this problem—we can stop it as soon as it finds one solution with no attacks.  Thus, to compare the two algorithms, what we should be comparing is the average number of evaluations it takes a GA to find ONE solution versus the average number of evaluations it takes enumeration to find ONE solution (its first legal solution).  The easiest way to do that enumeration task, in this small case with only 8 queens, is to run the enumeration once, tabulating the number of permutations and the number of them that are legal solutions.  Then one can calculate the average number of evaluations needed to find a solution via enumeration, assuming it were started from a random initial arrangement of queens (with only one per row and column).  \n","\n","### Exhaustive Search\n","\n","The ’C’ program appended does that, finding that there are 40,320 total permutations of the queens, and 92 of them are legal solutions to the eight queens problem.  That allows calculating the average time to find a solution by enumeration (if done from random starting points) as 443.26 evaluations.  That is about double the number of evaluations required by the GA (see Table I below), which is about 220, and, of course, that would become far more dramatic if the number of queens were larger.  I also implemented a version of the exhaustive search that starts from a random arrangement (one queen per row/column) and permutes them by Heap’s Algorithm until finding a first correct solution, then stops. The results of that algorithm are shown in the second column of Table I, and compared statistically with the GA results.\n","\n","### Genetic Algorithm\n","\n","I used the GALOPPS GA package (in ‘C’) that I wrote to do the GA solutions, using the same functions to calculate attacks as in the exhaustive code, and using order crossover and swap mutation as described in class. Unfortunately, I am not able to run it in the Jupyter Notebooks environment, so I am showing the results of 30 runs of the GA in Table I, showing in each case how many permutations it evaluated, starting from a random one, until finding a legal solution.  \n","\n","### Discussion\n","\n","There are many ways to attack the enumeration problem, including:\n","\n","1) You might enumerate all possible combinations of 8 queens among 8 the columns, which is 8**8, or 16,777,216 arrangements.  But that ignores the fact that we are not allowing any row to contain more than one queen, so is not a good way to solve this problem.\n","\n","2) You might recognize that you could enumerate column by column, so have 8 choices for the first column, then 7 for the second, then 6 for the third, etc., yielding 8! or 40,320 possibilities in total to be checked for any attacks. \n","\n","3) You might recognize that each of these 8! solutions that has only one queen in any row or column is a permutation of any other such solution, a permutation of the numbers (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8). (There are lots of ways to see this… including just permuting the COLUMNS of any initial solution (1 queen in each row, each column) without moving the rows of the queens in those columns, and there are 8! ways to do this. Each such permutation, of course, results in having only one queen in each row and each column.)  Storing the row index of the queen in each column is the “representation” that we suggested you use in your genetic algorithm solution of the problem.  Permuting these solutions is a much more efficient way to enumerate all possible board arrangements with exactly one queen per row or column.  There are only 8! or 40,320 such arrangements, so a much smaller number of arrangements to enumerate than 8**8.  We’ll discuss this in 4) below.\n","\n","4) To attack the enumeration problem DIRECTLY, we need our enumeration algorithm to be capable of producing all possible permutations, each exactly once, starting from an arbitrary permutation, and that is non-trivial to do.  B. R. Heap invented such an algorithm in 1963.  I have implemented his algorithm in a C program (my native language) and run 30 instances of it, each beginning with a different randomly chosen permutation.  Since you can’t run it in the Jupyter Notebook environment, I haven’t listed it here, but instead listed the code for the solution enumerating all solutions.  \n","\n","5) Of course, you could use the method I did above under “Exhaustive Search” and enumerate ALL solutions and divide the size of the search space by the total number of solutions found.  Perhaps some of you have done that.  \n","\n","\n","But I also implemented the direct enumeration approach, stopping as soon as a legal solution is found. The difference in means between the GA and enumeration approaches appears obvious, but perhaps not as large as a naïve comparison of average GA run time with TOTAL time to enumerate ALL solutions might have led you to believe—there are many solutions (namely, 92) that satisfy the 0-attacks criterion, so the average or median time to find the first one of them is much less than the total time to enumerate all solutions.  Here, 40,320/92 = 438.26, which is near the mean of what our direct (stopping at first success) enumeration algorithm below produced.\n","\n","If we wanted to use these runs to demonstrate that the mean solution times of the two algorithms are different statistically, we would perform a statistical test on data such as those in Table I.  Since we have no assurance that these evaluation numbers are normally distributed, rather than using something like a Student t-test, we use a Mann-Whitney U Test (also called the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test or the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test), which sorts all 60 values, and then calculates the probability that the resulting order of outputs from the two algorithms would occur in that fashion due to chance.  If the samples were paired rather than independent, we would instead use the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, a very similar test also heavily used in analyzing data produced by evolutionary computation.  Doing this Mann-Whitney U Test on these data produces the result that the difference is statistically significant at the level of 0.01044.  That is, the chance that such a set of results would occur if the two underlying distributions were identical is less than 0.01044, well below the level of .05 often used for such testing, but not so ridiculously small as to be essentially impossible.   This is a typical test used to compare results generated by evolutionary computation algorithms, if there is no assurance that their distributions are Gaussian (normal)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4Yh5pQToz6LP"},"source":["Table I: Number of solution evaluations to find a legal solution by a GA vs. by enumeration on Eight Queens.
